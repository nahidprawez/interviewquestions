 1. What is Express.js? Why do we use it?
 
 Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides
  a robust set of features for building single-page, multi-page, and RESTful APIs. 
 It simplifies the process of writing server-side logic, managing routing, middleware, and HTTP requests/responses.
 
 
 2. What is middleware in Express.js?
 Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request, response, and next() function in the request-response cycle. 
 Middleware can: 
 -Execute any code
 -Modify the request and response objects
 -End the request-response cycle
 -Call the next middleware in the stack
 

Example of Middleware:

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request Time:', Date.now());
  next();
});

3. What is the difference between app.use() and app.get()?

app.use() is used to register middleware or apply logic to all HTTP methods.
app.get() is used to handle GET requests for a specific route.

Example
app.use(loggerMiddleware); // Applies to all requests
app.get('/users', getUsersHandler); // Only GET /users


4. How do you handle errors in Express.js?
By defining a special middleware with four parameters, where the first parameter is the error.

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal Server Error' });
});

5. How do you define dynamic routes in Express?
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  res.send(`User ID: ${userId}`);
});


6. What is the role of next() in Express middleware?
next() passes control to the next middleware function in the stack. Without it, the request will hang unless a response is sent.

7. How do you create modular routes using express.Router()?
// userRoutes.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', getAllUsers);
router.post('/', createUser);

module.exports = router;

// app.js
const userRoutes = require('./routes/userRoutes');
app.use('/users', userRoutes);


8. What is the difference between req.params, req.query, and req.body?
req.params: For route parameters (/users/:id)
req.query: For URL query strings (/users?page=2)
req.body: For POST/PUT body data (requires body-parser or express.json())


9. How do you secure your Express app?
Use helmet to set secure HTTP headers
Use cors for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
Use rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks
Validate and sanitize inputs
Avoid exposing stack traces in production

10. What is CORS and how do you handle it in Express?
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) allows restricted resources to be requested from another domain.
Use the cors package:
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());

11. How do you implement environment-specific configurations in Express?
Use the dotenv package to manage environment variables.
require('dotenv').config();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

12. How do you implement rate limiting in Express?
Use the express-rate-limit middleware:
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 100
});
app.use(limiter);


13. What is the use of express.json() and express.urlencoded()?
express.json() parses incoming JSON requests.

express.urlencoded({ extended: true }) parses URL-encoded form data.
Both are necessary for reading request bodies.

14. How do you connect a MongoDB database in an Express app?
Using Mongoose:
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI)
  .then(() => console.log('DB Connected'))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));


15. Explain a RESTful route structure you use in Express.js
For a user resource:
GET /users → Get all users
GET /users/:id → Get single user
POST /users → Create user
PUT /users/:id → Update user
DELETE /users/:id → Delete user

Mock Interview:

Can you explain the concept of middleware in Express.js and give a real-world use case where you’ve implemented it?

Middleware in Express.js is a function that has access to the req, res, and next() objects in the request-response cycle. 
It is used to execute code, modify request/response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware.
In one of my projects, I built a custom authentication middleware for order-related APIs. 
The client would send an HMAC signature generated using an API key and secret.
 My middleware recreated the HMAC on the server side and compared it with the incoming one. 
 If they matched, the request was allowed to proceed via next(); otherwise, I returned a 401 Unauthorized response. 
 This helped ensure only trusted clients could access sensitive endpoints.

 What is the difference between app.use() and app.get() in Express? Can you provide examples where you’ve used each one?
