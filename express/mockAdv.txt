ðŸ§ª Mock Scenario: You have a Product collection and want to design a scalable API
Q1: How would you design a Product Schema for an e-commerce app?

Answer:

const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
   productId : {type : String, required: true},
   title :  {type : String, required : true},
   price :  {type : Number, required : true},
   category :  {type : String, required : true},
   images :  {type : String},
   inStock :  {type : Boolean, default : false},
  },
  {
     timestamps :  true
  }
)

Embedding the category as a string works perfectly if categories are not expected to change frequently. 
I have to keep queries lightweight and fast as I am not maintaining a separate categories collection (at least for now).

if the categories change frequently, I have to prefer create another document for categories list and referece it in the product schema.
