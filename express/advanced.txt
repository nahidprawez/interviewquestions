How do you handle performance optimization in large-scale Express applications?
Can you mention some middleware or techniques you've used to improve API performance?

Answer:
In large-scale Express applications, performance optimization is critical. I use several strategies:

Request Validation Early: 
I validate headers, query/body params, and authentication as early as possible to prevent unnecessary DB or external service calls.

Rate Limiting: 
I use express-rate-limit to throttle incoming traffic and prevent abuse, especially for sensitive or costly APIs like payment or order actions.

Middleware-Based Token Validation: 
For example, in a cancelOrder API for a Shopify app, I implemented a verifyRequest middleware that checks the HMAC or token from request headers. If invalid, the request is immediately rejected.

Strict Schema Validation: 
Inside the actual route handler (orderCancel), I strictly validate required fields like shop and orderId before proceeding. 
This avoids unexpected failures deeper in the flow.

Sanitization and Security: 
I use libraries like express-validator or Joi to sanitize inputs and prevent injection attacks.
These layered checks ensure the API handles only valid requests, reducing load and improving speed and reliability under high traffic.

How do you handle asynchronous errors in Express.js?
Can you give an example of how you avoid repetitive try-catch blocks in async routes?

Answer:
In Express.js, I handle asynchronous errors using try-catch inside the route handlers. 
But to avoid repeating this pattern in every route, I wrap async handlers in a reusable error-handling wrapper function.

Here's how I handle it:
1. Async Handler Wrapper – asyncHandler.js

export const asyncHandler = (fn) => (req, res, next) => Promise.resolve(fn(req, res, next)).catch(next);

2. Using it in a Route:

import { asyncHandler } from './utils/asyncHandler.js';

export const getOrders = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const { shop } = req.body;
  if (!shop) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Shop is required' });
  }

  const ordersInfo = await orderDetails(shop);
  if (!ordersInfo) {
    return res.status(404).json({ message: 'No orders found' });
  }

  res.status(200).json({ data: ordersInfo.data, success: true });
});

3. Global Error Handler Middleware:
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err);
  res.status(500).json({ message: err.message || 'Internal Server Error' });
});

I use try-catch inside async route handlers for basic error handling. 
But to reduce code repetition and improve maintainability, I create a reusable asyncHandler wrapper. 
It ensures all unhandled errors are automatically passed to the centralized error middleware using next(err). 
This keeps the route code clean and consistent.

I also return meaningful status codes like 400 for bad requests and 404 when data is not found.

What’s the difference between custom middleware and built-in middleware in Express?
Have you written any custom middleware? Share a real use-case from your projects.

Answer:
In Express.js, middleware functions are used to handle the request-response cycle. There are two types:

1. Built-in Middleware:
These are provided by Express itself, such as:

express.json() – to parse incoming JSON payloads

express.urlencoded() – to parse URL-encoded data

express.static() – to serve static files

2. Custom Middleware:
These are user-defined functions that can perform tasks like validation, authentication, 
logging, etc. They follow the standard (req, res, next) signature and are added to routes 
or globally using app.use() or directly in route chains.

🔍 Example from my project:
I created a custom middleware called verifyRequest to validate Shopify HMAC tokens for order-related APIs. 

This middleware:
Reads the headers and token
Validates it against the server-side secret
Calls next() if the token is valid
Otherwise, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response.

export const verifyRequest = (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const token = req.headers['x-shopify-hmac-sha256'];
    // Validate token logic...
    if (isValidToken(token)) {
      next();
    } else {
      return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized request' });
    }
  } catch (err) {
    next(err); // Forward to centralized error handler
  }
};

I also use a global error-handling middleware at the bottom of the app to catch any unhandled errors and return proper responses.

How do you handle file uploads in Express.js?
Which libraries have you used (e.g., Multer), and how do you validate uploaded files?

Answer:

Yes, I’ve implemented file uploads in Express.js using Multer, which is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data.
 It’s especially useful for uploading images or documents from the frontend.

Frontend Integration:
In one of my projects, I used Shopify Polaris’s <DropZone> component for file uploads. 
On the frontend, I used FormData to append the selected files:

const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', selectedFile);

The request was sent using POST with enctype="multipart/form-data" — which is essential for file uploads.

Backend (Express):
On the server side, I used Multer and set up middleware like:

import multer from 'multer';
const storage = multer.memoryStorage(); // or diskStorage
const upload = multer({
  storage,
  limits: { fileSize: 2 * 1024 * 1024 }, // 2MB max
  fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {
    if (file.mimetype.startsWith('image/')) {
      cb(null, true);
    } else {
      cb(new Error('Invalid file type'), false);
    }
  },
});

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  // handle file logic
  res.json({ success: true });
});

I’ve used:
upload.single('file') for single file upload
upload.array('files') for multiple files
Validation using mimetype and limits (file size, count)

I also handle Multer errors centrally using Express error-handling middleware for better maintainability and consistent responses.

What are some performance or security best practices you follow in large-scale Express apps?

In large-scale Express applications, I follow a combination of performance and security best practices
 to ensure the system is scalable, stable, and secure.

 Security Practices:
 JWT-based Authentication & Authorization:
Every sensitive API is protected using JWT tokens, validated via middleware.

Centralized Error Handling:
I use a global middleware to catch and respond to all uncaught exceptions, ensuring consistent API responses and better debugging.

Input Validation:
I validate req.body, req.params, and req.query to avoid injection attacks and invalid data using either custom middleware or libraries like express-validator.

Rate Limiting:
I use express-rate-limit to prevent brute-force attacks and reduce abuse on public APIs.

Secure Headers:
I configure headers using Helmet to enhance API security (e.g., CSP, XSS protection).

Log Sanitization:
I avoid logging sensitive data like tokens or passwords in production logs.

 Performance Practices:

 Optimized MongoDB Queries:
I structure schemas efficiently by:
Using referencing for relational data
Using embedded documents for frequently accessed nested data

Indexing:
I use proper indexing on searchable fields (like shop, orderId, email) to speed up query execution.

Asynchronous Code & Await Best Practices:
I make sure all database calls are properly awaited and use try/catch for safe handling.

Caching (where applicable):
For extremely high-frequency read data, I consider caching (e.g., Redis) to offload database hits.

Minimal Payloads:
I ensure only required fields are selected from DB queries to reduce response size and improve speed.

For example, in my Shopify order APIs, I implemented token-based verification via middleware, 
validated request headers and payloads, and optimized the database structure to return only the essential
order data — resulting in reduced response time and improved stability under load.
